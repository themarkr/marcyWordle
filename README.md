# marcyWordle
A Wordle re-make with additional functionality created by Jason Padilla and Mark Rodriguez

## Key Features ##
- Difficulty Slider
> The difficulty slider is one additional function that we implemented to allow users to decide for themselves the level of challenge that they want to experience while playing our game. Users can increase the number of attempts per game or decrease the number of attempts based on the value of this slider. 

- Word Length Slider (buggy)
> The word length slider is the other additional function that we implemented to allow users to decide for themselves the length of the word that they are guessing for that game. Users can increase the length or decrease the length of the hidden word that they are guessing each round of the game.
